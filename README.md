## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

install the package
   ```sh
   pip install matrix_operations_for_the_basic_people
   ```
## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This project is part of the portfolio exercises required to complete the Data Scientist Nanodegree from Udacity. The main purpose is to design a PyPi package that can be used to perform basic operations for matrices.

## Package Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is 1 main executable in the package which is the Matrices.py file in the matrix_operations folder. The main class Matrix can be used to perform basic matrix operations including addition, subtraction and multiplication. The class requires two inputs in the form of a nested list and returns the result in the same data type. 

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>

The license of the PyPi can be found in the license.txt file. Feel free to use the package as you like!
